    "### Column Descriptions\n",
    "* fixed acidity: A value representing the concentration of non-volatile acids in the wine. An example of a fixed acis is tartaric acid.\n",
    "* volatile acidity: A value representing the concentration of volatile acids in the wine. An example of a volatile acid is acetic acid.\n",
    "* citric acid: Amount of citric acid in the wine. Citric acid is a weak organic chemical present in wine in small quantities. Citric acid is known to add freshness and enhance the wine’s flavor and aroma.\n",
    "* residual sugar: The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation. A higher residual sugar content will result in a sweeter wine.\n",
    "* chlorides: The concentration of salt in the wine. A higher chloride concentration may indicate a higher salinity and can negatively affect wine flavor.\n",
    "* free sulfur dioxide: Free sulfur dioxide refers to the portion of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) that is not bound to other molecules and acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant agent. Optimal levels of free sulfur dioxide help preserve wine, but excessive SO₂ can affect taste and aroma.\n",
    "* total sulfur dioxide: The total amount of free and bound SO₂. Optimal levels help to preserve wine, but excessive SO₂ can affect taste and aroma.\n",
    "* density: This value represents the density of the wine. The density will be related to the sugar and alcohol content. Higher sugar content will increase density, while higher alcohol content will decrase it.\n",
    "* pH: The pH level ndicates the acidity level of the wine. Lower pH means higher acidity. The pH level affects microbial stability, color, and taste.\n",
    "* sulphates: Sulphates (often potassium sulphate) contribute to sulfur dioxide levels. Similar to the sulfur dioxide columns, this is an indicator of the presence of preservatives. Optimal levels help to preserve wine, but excessive levels can affect taste and aroma.\n",
    "* target: the target represents the wine quality evaluated by wine experts, scored based on sensory data. The scores range from 0 (very bad) to 10 (very excellent). "
