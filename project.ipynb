    "* chlorides: The concentration of salt in the wine. A higher chloride concentration may indicate a higher salinity and can negatively affect wine flavor.\n",
    "* free sulfur dioxide: Free sulfur dioxide refers to the portion of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) that is not bound to other molecules and acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant agent. Optimal levels of free sulfur dioxide help preserve wine, but excessive SO₂ can affect taste and aroma.\n",
    "* total sulfur dioxide: The total amount of free and bound SO₂. \n",
